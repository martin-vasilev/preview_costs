## maximal vertical and horizontal distance for replacing pixels
## only useful for PNGs with a reasonable high resolution, but
## do not set the limits too narrow (danger of not breaking out of loop)

## THE SCRIPT PRODUCES ANTI-ALIASES PNGs
## YOU CAN PROBABLY IMPROVE THE "TARGET-ABILITY" OF THE DEGRADED STIMs
## BY TURNING THE ANTIALIASES PIXEL TO BLACK - CHECK IT OUT
## HERE IS THE OPTION - default should be FALSE
## define an alternative mono-chrome color, if you wish (but most probably, 
## you will want black (i.e., 0) 
## IF YOU CHOOSE 1, THEN THE SCRIPT PERFORMS PIXEL REMOVAL!!!!!!!!!
